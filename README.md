# clonenetflix
Description: This project is a simple front-end clone of the Netflix homepage using only HTML and CSS. It mimics the overall look and feel of the original Netflix website, including the navigation bar, featured content banner, and rows of movie or TV show thumbnails. The project aims to provide a visually similar experience to the official Netflix homepage, helping beginners learn fundamental HTML and CSS techniques.

Navigation Bar: A top navbar with the Netflix logo, navigation links (Home, TV Shows, Movies, etc.), and user profile icon.
Hero Section: A large banner section featuring a popular movie or TV show with a title, description, and buttons (e.g., "Play", "More Info").
Content Rows: Multiple rows of content, each showcasing a set of movies or TV shows with thumbnails.
Footer: A footer section with links to various pages (About, Help Center, Terms of Use, etc.).
